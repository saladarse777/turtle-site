    <!-- Main Paragraph -->
    <p style="font-family: verdana">Turtles are an order of reptiles known as Testudine, they are known for their iconic shells that developed mainly from their ribs. Modern turtles are divided into two major groups, the side-necked turtles and hidden neck turtles which differ in the way the head retracts. Turtle shells are made mostly of bone; the upper part is the domed carapace, while the underside is the flatter plastron or belly-plate. Its outer surface is covered in scales made of keratin, the material of hair, horns, and claws. The carapace bones develop from ribs that grow sideways and develop into broad flat plates that join up to cover the body. Turtles are ectotherms or "cold-blooded", meaning that their internal temperature varies with their direct environment.</p>
    <p style="font-family: verdana">They are generally opportunistic omnivores and mainly feed on plants and animals with limited movements. Many turtles migrate short distances seasonally. Sea turtles are the only reptiles that migrate long distances to lay their eggs on a favored beach. Turtles have appeared in myths and folktales around the world. Some terrestrial and freshwater species are widely kept as pets. Turtles have been hunted for their meat, for use in traditional medicine, and for their shells. Sea turtles are often killed accidentally as bycatch in fishing nets. Turtle habitats around the world are being destroyed. As a result of these pressures, many species are threatened with extinction.</p>

    <!-- Ending Notes -->
    <p style="font-family: verdana">Many Turtles and other sea creatures in the ocean are in threat of plastic pollutions because of humans. Many Turtles mistakingly eat plastic bags instead of jellyfish causing them to either choke or get no nutrients for it to survive. That's also why we humans should not throw plastic in our oceans. A good way of preventing this is by participating in cleaning programs or donating to charities that specifically work on these kinds of topic like <a href="https://teamseas.org/">Team Seas</a>.</p>
