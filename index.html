            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Turtles are an order of reptiles known as Tetsudine, they are known for their iconic shells that developed mainly from their ribs.
            Modern turtles are divided into two major groups, the side-necked turtles and hidden neck turtles which differ in the way the head retracts. 
            Turtle shells are made mostly of bone; the upper part is the domed carapace, while the underside is the flatter plastron or belly-plate. Its outer surface is covered in scales made of keratin, the material of hair, horns, and claws.
            The carapace bones develop from ribs that grow sideways and develop into broad flat plates that join up to cover the body. Turtles are ectotherms or "cold-blooded", 
            meaning that their internal temperature varies with their direct environment.
        </p>
        <p>
            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They are generally opportunistic omnivores and mainly feed on plants and animals with limited movements. Many turtles migrate short distances seasonally. Sea turtles are the only reptiles that migrate long distances to lay their eggs on a favored beach. 
            Turtles have appeared in myths and folktales around the world. Some terrestrial and freshwater species are widely kept as pets. Turtles also have been hunted for their meat, shells, and for use in traditional medicine.
            Sea turtles are often killed accidentally as bycatch in fishing nets and pollution. Turtle habitats around the world are being destroyed. As a result of these pressures, many species are threatened with extinction.

        <p style="text-align: center; font-size: xx-large; font-family: monospace;">Here are some famous turtle species: </p>

    <div class="example">
        <br><p style="font-family: monospace; font-size: xx-large;">Green Sea Turtle</p>
        <img class="tortleExample" src="https://encrypted-tbn0.gstatic.com/images?q=tbn:ANd9GcT-_sojR9sYwmTHR6hdBBVsEMjskyMY4UtW4w&usqp=CAU">
        <li style="display:-webkit-flex;"></li>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The most iconic of them all, these turtles specialize on swimming in the oceans and feast on jellyfish.
            They are easily distinguished from other sea turtles because they have a single pair of prefrontal scales (scales in front of its eyes), 
            rather than two pairs as found on other sea turtles. 
        </p>
        <p>
            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Head is small and blunt with a serrated jaw. Carapace is bony without ridges and has 
            large, non-overlapping, scutes (scales) present with only 4 lateral scutes. Body is nearly oval and is more depressed (flattened) compared 
            to Pacific green turtles. All flippers have 1 visible claw. The carapace color varies from pale to very dark green and plain to 
            very brilliant yellow, brown and green tones with radiating stripes. The plastron varies from white, dirty white or yellowish in the 
            Atlantic populations to dark grey-bluish-green in the Pacific populations. Hatchlings are dark-brown or nearly black with a white underneath 
            and white flipper margins.

        <br><p style="font-family: monospace; font-size: xx-large; text-align: left;">Tortoise</p>
        <img class="tortleExample" src="https://encrypted-tbn0.gstatic.com/images?q=tbn:ANd9GcRYN5JqzlVe7x9mj9f6xkpngS9T-DZz89devCAgYyxC6jsH-f-Z1CA-zhI&s=10">
        <li style="display: -webkit-flex;"></li>
        <p>
            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Considered to be one of the oldest species of tutrles and are more specialized on walking. Some Tortoise can be kept as pets.
            Tortoises are exclusively terrestrial and occur on all continents except Australia and Antarctica. They also inhabit many islands, although numerous island populations and species are now extinct because of human occupation. 
        </p>
        <p>  
            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Tortoises live in a variety of habitats, from deserts to wet tropical forests.
            Most tortoises are vegetarians and eat foliage, flowers, and fruits; some tortoise species from moist forest habitats are more opportunistic and consume animal matter.
            Differences exist in usage of the common terms turtle, tortoise, and terrapin, depending on the variety of English being used; usage is inconsistent and contradictory. 
            These terms are common names and do not reflect precise biological or taxonomic distinctions.

        <br><p style="font-family: monospace; font-size: xx-large; text-align: left;">Alligator Snapping Turtle</p>
        <img class="tortleExample" src="https://www.biologicaldiversity.org/news/press_releases/2014/images/Alligator_Snapping_Turtle_Garry_Tucker_USFWS.jpg">
        <li style="display: -webkit-flex;"></li>
        <p>
            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One of the most dangerous species known for their hard and sharp beak. Some have lost their fingers from it's strong bite.
            The alligator snapping turtle is given its common name because of its immensely powerful jaws and distinct ridges on its shell that are similar in appearance to the rough, ridged skin of an alligator.
            It is also slightly less commonly known as "the loggerhead snapper".
        </p>
        <p>
            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Alligator snappers spend most of their lives in water, the exception being when females trudge about 160 feet inland to nest. They can stay submerged for 40 to 50 minutes before surfacing for air.
            The alligator snapper employs a unique natural lure in its hunting technique. Its tongue sports a bright-red, worm-shaped piece of flesh that, when displayed by a motionless turtle on a river bottom,
            draws curious fish or frogs close enough to be snatched.

        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Many Turtles and other sea creatures in the ocean are in threat of plastic pollutions because of humans. 
        Many Turtles mistakingly eat plastic bags instead of jellyfish causing them to either choke or get no nutrients for it to survive. That's also why we humans should not throw plastic in our oceans. 
        A good way of preventing this is by participating in cleaning programs or donating to charities that specifically work on these kinds of topic like Team Seas.Toxic metals may concentrate in the liver and kidneys of sea turtles. 
        Toxins like mercury also pose a threat to human health. Chronic exposure to pollutants makes sea turtles susceptible to disease and death. Chronically ill turtles are also more vulnerable to predation and collisions with boats.
